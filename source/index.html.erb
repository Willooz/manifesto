    Free citizens of this century...

  <p class="align-left">
    Be happy! Happiness is a state of mind. It precedes any undertaking in life. Work doesn't make you happy or unhappy. You do! So start now. Choose what makes you happy! :)
  </p>
  <p class="align-left">
    Don't be captive. Remember your work is <i>your</i> contribution. No one else owns it. Don't be tamed. Work is an adult endeavor. You are no longer being taught. Take control, deliver, make an impact. Find pleasure in being a professional. Earn respect and recognition.
  </p>
  <p class="align-left">
    Be free and independent. You are more educated and sociable than anyone has ever been before (whatever your age is). Learn faster from more people. Articulate complex ideas and build original creations. Be the innovation resource so prized in this century.
  </p>
  <p class="align-left">
    The Internet changes everything. Access information, build relationships and grow an audience of a scale that was never possible before. The network bypasses traditional power structures. Weave your one web of connections. Make your voice matter. Share, contribute, lead projects you are passionate about. This is fun. You should be happy about such an opportunity!

    Leaders of innovative enterprises...
  </h3>
  <p class="align-left">
    You know that better people and a new social realm will greatly impact the nature of the job market and the corporate world in the decades ahead. Most of the power structures established to organise life and work in the corporation will no longer be needed, especially heavy hierarchies and impersonal command and control management cultures.
  </p>
  <p class="align-left">
    You are also aware that the massive disengagement of employees at work is a symptom of social change happening faster than organisational change in the corporation. Yet human capital differentiates those of you who innovate from those who compete on cost. So how nurture it?
  </p>
  <p class="align-left">
    Don't define every work task, explain the mission and show the way. Don't review every result, trust competence and learning abilities. Don't dictate rules, bet on good judgement and decision-making ability. Don't evaluate, guide and coach. Don't subordinate, free and grow. Don't control, empower. It is your decision.
  </p>
  <p class="align-left">
    Learn from the impacts of the Internet on society and embrace technology as a means of bringing your people closer together, putting them in control and making them responsible. You will be rewarded twice by saving on the costs of the old bureaucratic structure and by getting more from engaged people.
