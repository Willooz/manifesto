  <h3>Leaders of innovative enterprises...</h3>
  <p>
    Change the corporation! Address employee disengagement. Choose employee success! Build an organisation as strong as the skills and networks of your people. Distinguish yourself from those who compete on cost. Innovate. Bet on human capital.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't perpetuate an impersonal command and control culture. Rely on individual and networked talent.Don't define every work task, show the way. Don't review every result, invest in learning. Don't dictate rules, trust good judgement. Don't control, empower. Don't evaluate, guide. Don't subordinate, free.
  </p>
  <p>
    Embrace technology to bring people closer together, put them in control and allow them to grow. Use it to multiply connections at a personal level and understand aggregate phenomena. You will be rewarded twice by saving on the costs of a bureaucracy and by getting more from successful people!
