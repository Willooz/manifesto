  <h3>Free workforce of this century...</h3>
  <p>
    <span class="super-heavy">Be happy!</span> Happiness is a state of mind. It precedes any undertaking in life. <span class="heavy">Work doesn't make you happy or unhappy. </span><span class="super-heavy">You do!</span> So make professional decisions you're happy about <span class="super-heavy">now!</span> :)
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't be captive. Be free and independent. Aknowledge your unique strengths. Grow your self-esteem. Don't be tamed. Take ownership and responsibility. Work is an adult endeavor. You are no longer being taught, you are making a contribution. Be a professional. Earn respect and recognition.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Internet changes everything. Access information, build relationships and grow an audience of a scale that was never possible before. The network bypasses traditional power structures. Weave your one web of connections. Learn faster from more people. Be the innovation resource so prized in this century. Make your voice matter. Share, contribute, lead projects you are passionate about. Opportunities are endless. You should be happy!

  <h3>Leaders of innovative enterprises...</h3>
  <p>
    Change the corporation! Address employee disengagement. Choose employee success! Build an organisation as strong as the skills and networks of your people. Distinguish yourself from those who compete on cost. Innovate. Bet on human capital.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't perpetuate an impersonal command and control culture. Rely on individual and networked talent. Don't define every work task, show the way. Don't review every result, value learning. Don't dictate rules, trust good judgement. Don't control, empower. Don't evaluate, guide. Don't subordinate, free!
  </p>
  <p>
    Embrace technology to bring people closer together, put them in control and allow them to grow. Use technology to multiply connections at a personal level and understand aggregate phenomena. You will be rewarded twice by saving on the costs of a bureaucracy and by getting more from successful people!
